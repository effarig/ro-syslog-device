SysLogDevice
============


Requirements
------------
RISC OS 3 or later.
26/32 bit compatible.
SysLog.


Installation
------------
Use the !Boot System merge tool to merge the supplied system with the one
in this distribution. Or if you prefer, it can be manually installed in
System:310.Modules.


Introduction
------------
SysLogDevice provides a write only DeviceFS device driver which sends its
output to a SysLog log. This allows a SysLog log to be written to like a
standard file, e.g.

    *echo Hello { > Devices#log=Test;priority=1:$.SysLog }

Usage
-----
To use SysLogDevice, you need to do something like:

    RmEnsure SysLogDevice 0.02 RmLoad System:Modules.SysLogDev

Note: SysLogDevice does not ensure SysLog is running, see the documentation
supplied with !SysLog to do this. If SysLog is not running logging is
silently discarded.

To write to a log called `Test`, open a writable file:

    Devices#log=Test:$.SysLog

The file path special field (the bit between the `#` and the ':$') is
used to pass parameters. The `log` parameter determines which log to
write to and must be present.

Multiple streams can be opened onto the same or different logs.

Special Field Parameters
------------------------
In addition to those provided by DeviceFS, the following special field
parameters in the log file path are interpreted by the SysLogDevice
module:

  | Parameter  | Type    | Descrption                                    |
  | ---------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
  | `log`      | string  | Name of log to write to; mandatory.           |
  | `priority` | integer | Log priority (level); optional, default `64`. |

The value of a parameter is separated from the name by an equals sign and
parameters are separated by semicolons.


Limitations
-----------
The data written to the device is assumed to be plain text, each line
terminated by a control character, ASCII 0-31. Empty lines are filtered out.

There is, at present, a limit on the maximum line length (1K at present), any
lines longer than this are broken into multiple log messages.

The SysLog device is write only.

Note: At the time of writing the 'ARMLib' library is not yet published so
this cannot be built from source yet.
